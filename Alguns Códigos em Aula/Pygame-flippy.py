# Flippy (an "Othello" or "Reversi" clone)

"""IMPORTANT NOTE: All of the "logic" part of this program (the code for the AI player and code that handles game play) is basically copied and pasted from the text-based Othello game that was featured in the "Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python" book (freely available at http://inventwithpython.com).

You might want to read through that code and chapter 15 of the book before looking through this code, because I really only cover the Pygame parts in the source code. http://inventwithpython.com/chapter15.html

Basically, this program == (old text-based othello program) - (text & keyboard stuff) + (Pygame graphics & mouse stuff).

You should compare the code between these two programs to see how you could go about reusing other people's code and giving it a new makeover.
"""

"""
Welcome to the Code Comments for Flippy, an Othello clone. Code Comments is a series of simple games with detailed comments in the source code, so you can see how the game works.

The text in between the triple-double-quotes are comments. The Python interpreter ignores any text in between them, so we can add any comments about the source code without affecting the program. In general for Code Comments, the comments will describe the lines of code above the comment. It helps to view this file either on the Code Comments site or with a text editor that does "syntax highlighting", so that the comments appear in a separate color and are easier to distinguish from the code.

This Code Comments assumes you know some basic Python programming. If you are a beginner and would like to learn computer programming, there is a free book online called "Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python" at http://inventwithpython.com

The Code Comments programs make references to sections of this book throughout the program. This Code Comments can also teach you how to use the Pygame library to make your own games with graphics, animation, and sound. You can download Pygame from http://pygame.org and view its documentation at http://pygame.org/docs/

HOW TO PLAY FLIPPY
Place down tiles so that you have your opponent's tiles in between your newly placed tile and one of your existing tiles. All of your opponent's surrounded tiles will be flipped to become your colored tiles. You and the computer take turns placing down tiles until no more moves can be made. The player with the most tiles of their color on the board at the end wins.

Note that tiles on the side of the board are less likely to be surrounded, and any tiles on the corners can never be flipped.

There is a hints mode which can be toggled on to show you every valid move you can make on the board.

"""Here we import modules that our game needs. random has random number functions, time has the sleep() function, sys has the exit() function, and pygame contains all the pygame-related functions.

pygame.locals contains constants like MOUSEMOTION and MOUSEBUTTONUP and QUIT for the events. It's easier to type MOUSEBUTTONUP instead of pygame.locals.MOUSEBUTTONUP, so we use the "from pygame.locals import *" format to import these to the local namespace.

FPS = 10 # frames per second to update the screen
WINDOWWIDTH = 640 # width of the program's window, in pixels
WINDOWHEIGHT = 480 # height in pixels
SPACESIZE = 50 # width & height of each space on the board, in pixels
BOARDWIDTH = 8 # how many columns of spaces on the game board
BOARDHEIGHT = 8 # how many rows of spaces on the game board
"""These constant variables (the uppercase names means we shouldn't change the values stored in them) set some standard values for our game. You can play around with different values for them (though some values might cause bugs in the game.) By using constants instead of the values directly, it is easier to make changes since we only have to change them in one place.

For example, if we used 20 instead of SPACESIZE, then if we wanted to change our code later we'd have to change every place in the code we find 20. This is trickier than just changing the one line where SPACESIZE is originally set.

WINDOWWIDTH and WINDOWHEIGHT give the size of the window in pixels. FPS is how often we redraw the image to the screen in frames per second. SPACESIZE is the size (in pixels) of the individual space that make up the tetromino pieces. Because the spaces are squares, SPACESIZE will be used for both the space width and height.

BOARDWIDTH and BOARDHEIGHT give the size of the playing board, in blocks. An 8 x 8 board is 64 spaces big (that is, 8 times 8).

"""XMARGIN and YMARGIN are technically constants, since the values in these variables never change. The value we put inside of these constants are calculated from the values of other constants.

We want to calculate how much horizontal space is on either side of the board. This depends on the width of the window, the width of the board, and the size of each space. We take the full width of the window, and want to subtract the width of the board in pixels (which is BOARDWIDTH * BLOCKSIZE). This gives us the amount of space on either side of the board, so we divide by two to get the width of just one of these margins. We do the same for the margin on top and on the bottom of the board."""

# Colors used in the game

"""We also set up some constant values for different colors. Pygame uses tuples of three integers to represent color. The integers represent the amount of red, green, and blue in the color (this is commonly called a RGB). 0 means there == None of the primary color in the color, and 255 means there is the maximum amount. So (255, 0, 0) is red, since it has the maximum amount of red but no green or blue. But (255, 0, 255) adds the max amount of blue with the red, creating purple.

First we set some color constants with the 3-tuple values, and then assign other constants to these color constants. It is much easier to see that the background color is bright blue with BGCOLOR = BRIGHTBLUE rather than BGCOLOR = (0, 50, 255)

BGCOLOR will store the color we use for behind the game board. BOARDBGCOLOR is the color of the board itself, and GRIDLINECOLOR is the color used for the lines in between each space.

All the text in the game will be the same color (stored in TEXTCOLOR). We will be using the 'X' and 'O' string values (mostly because it is simple and this was how it was done in the text version of this program) but we will want XPLAYERCOLOR and OPLAYERCOLOR to remember what colors 'X' and 'O' stand for. HINTCOLOR is the size of the small boxes that appear in hint mod.

What we want to do is keep calling playGame() as long as the call to playGame() returns True (which indicates that the player wants to play another game.) So when this while statement's condition is first evaluated, we call playGame() which goes through an entire game of Flippy with the player. When that game is over, playGame() will either return True or False. If it returns False, then the while statement's condition will evaluate to False and program execution will jump past the while loop. (This will be at the end of the main() function, meaning that the function returns and eventually the program terminates.)

        If playGame() returns True, then that indicates that the player wants to play another game. So the while statement's condition will also evaluate to True and program execution jumps inside the while loop's block. But the only piece of code inside this block is a pass statment.

        The pass statement does absolutely nothing (just like a comment does nothing.) After executing the pass statement (that is, after doing nothing), we reach the end of the while loop so we jump back to and reevaluate the while loop's condition. Of course, in the process of evaluating the condition again, the playGame() function is called and an entire game of Flippy is played out again.

        The reason we need a pass statement here is because the Python interpreter expects SOMETHING inside the while loop block. If we just had nothing after the while statement, then the next line of code would be interpretted as the first line of the while loop. Most likely this line of code would have the wrong level of indentation, and this would cause an error in our program.
