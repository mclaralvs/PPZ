"""
Welcome to the Code Comments for Ink Spill. Code Comments is a series of simple games with detailed comments in the source code, so you can see how the game works.

The text in between the triple-double-quotes are comments. The Python interpreter ignores any text in between them, so we can add any comments about the source code without affecting the program. In general for Code Comments, the comments will describe the lines of code above the comment. It helps to view this file either on the Code Comments site or with a text editor that does "syntax highlighting", so that the comments appear in a separate color and are easier to distinguish from the code.

This Code Comments assumes you know some basic Python programming. If you are a beginner and would like to learn computer programming, there is a free book online called "Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python" at http://inventwithpython.com

The Code Comments programs make references to sections of this book throughout the program. This Code Comments can also teach you how to use the Pygame library to make your own games with graphics, animation, and sound. You can download Pygame from http://pygame.org and view its documentation at http://pygame.org/docs/

HOW TO PLAY INK SPILL:
Click on the colored palettes at the bottom to change the color of the top left box. Any boxes connected to this box with the same color will also have their color changed. The goal of the game is to turn the entire board to a single color before running out of turns.

    So, like a zombie plague, these calls to flood() will result in more calls to flood(). And the function calls only stop when they hit the border of the board or a box that has a different color than the one specified by oldColorNum.

If this script is imported by another script's import statement, then the value of __name__ will be the name of the file (if this script still has the name inkspill.py, then the __name__ variable will contain 'inkspill').

    This is really handy if we ever want to use the functions that are in this program in another program. By having this if statement here, which then runs the main() function, we could have another program use "import inkspill" and make use of any of the functions we've already written. Or if you want to test individual functions by calling them from the interactive shell, you could call them without running the game program. This trick is really handy for code reuse."""
